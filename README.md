![Progress](https://progress-bar.dev/85/?title=progress)

This is a Quarto template for creating open assignments using the Quarto publishing system. A single `.qmd` source file can produce USYD-branded documents in HTML, PDF and MS Word formats. Supports publishing to Github Pages.

Note that these are not official templates, but they do follow the University of Sydney's branding guidelines.

If you use this template, you're expected to know how to use Quarto and the command line. If you're not familiar with Quarto, please see the [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/getting-started.html) for more information.

## Using this template

The simplest way to use this template is to click on the green "**Code**" button above and select "**Download ZIP**". Once you unzip the file, you can open the `.qmd` file in your favourite text editor and start editing.

If you are well-versed in Quarto and the CLI, run the following command in your terminal to use this template directly:

```sh
quarto use template usyd-soles-edu/soles-assignment
```

If you know Git, click on the green "**Use this template**" button above to create a new repository based on this template. An advantage in using this method is that you can import all branches from this repository, setting yourself up to publish to GitHub Pages without any further configuration.

## Publishing on Github Pages

You can manually set up Github Pages to publish your assignment. For more information please see the Quarto [documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html)
