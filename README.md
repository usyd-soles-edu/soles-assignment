# SOLES assignment Quarto Template

This is a Quarto template for creating computational assignments such as statistical practicals and tutorials.
It uses minimal branding -- using the University of Sydney brand guidelines -- and is designed to be accessible in multiple formats.

## Using this template

At some point this template will be available as a Quarto extension.

## Under construction

More tasks will be added as the template is developed.

- [ ] Add a minimal example
- [ ] Add branding
- [ ] Include automatic publishing
- [ ] Add instructions
- [ ] Link to examples
- [ ] Output to PDF
- [ ] Output to `learnr`? Maybe a dedicated `learnr` template is better...
