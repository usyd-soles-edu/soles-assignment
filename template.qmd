## Exercise 1

Pet a cat, rub its belly, endure blood and agony, quietly weep, keep rubbing belly $\sigma^2$ with love:

$$ \sigma^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \mu)^2}{n} $$ {#eq-a}


Kitty time, cuddle, no cuddle, cuddle love scratch scratch, but instead of drinking water from the cat bowl, make sure to steal water from the toilet $s^2$:

$$ s^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1} $$ {#eq-b}

a. Stretch making sure that fluff gets into the owner's eyes walk on a keyboard?
